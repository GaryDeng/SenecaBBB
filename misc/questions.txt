1) We started talking about retrieving records over the conference. 

2) Will the admin populate the 'section' part of the db for each professor? Is this a reasonable job for the admin if there are many (100+) professors?

3) We need a way to create accounts that are not part of LDAP. Does admin do this or should professors be allowed to?

4) Different access levels on user accounts (if student has been naughty we may not want to ban him, maybe just revoke his right to create meetings)

5) Separate pages for viewing past recordings and archived recordings or merge them into one table/list (not db table)

6) Stress testing. We need a lot of fake data to see how responsive and and easy to use system is with a lot of entries.

7) Restriction on number of meetings to join. Users should only be in one meeting at once, and shouldn't be allowed to create a meeting while they're in one.

8) Db table for system settings (global time out, etc)
